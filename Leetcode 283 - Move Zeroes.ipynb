The part that takes most time is the moving of the elements after a zero is found in the \"wait zone.\" In the resulting array, there is a fix position for a nonzero value in the array, i.e., if 5 is the third nonzero value in the input array, its final position (index) should be 2, but in the bruteforce solution, what we do is to move them one position at a time. To address this inefficiency, what we need is a way to move the nonzero values from their positions in the original array directly to the positions in the final array. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the current solution, there are two ways we can do to optimize the algorithm. The first is to exchange the zeros in the \"wait zone\" to the beginning of the \"zero zone\" and do the movement of the other elements in the \"wait zone\". This will not work because it reduces the movement number a bit but it does not decrease time complexity to O(N).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way is to exchange the zeros with the element right before the first element in the \"zero zone.\" But the resulting array will break the relative order of the nonzero values, failing to meet the first requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way is to flip the \"wait zone\" and the \"zero zone,\" i.e., put the \"zero zone\" before the \"wait zone.\" In this case, the nonzero counter is pointing to the first element in the \"zero zone,\" and then the value, nonzero counter + zero counter, will be pointing to the first element of the \"wait zone.\" Here let's call the value \"front.\"\n",
