And if this substring between the left and right positions still contains all characters of string t, It means we have a one-character shorter answer than the one we found previously.

Then in the next step, we should not forward the left position again because if this substring does not satisfy our need, the next substring will not either. Here we should move the right position again if it has not reached the last character of the string s.\n",

    "For the first option, it is not a good choice, because if we set the right position next to the left position and move forward again, we would have to explore some substrings we know will not contain all characters of string t, that is, substrings with the current left position and a right position between the one next to the current left position and the right position before the reset. Hence the only logical move is 2, move the right position forward.\n",
